# Bug:
    This code is assigning the 'year' variable as a string and trying to do
    numerical comparisons on it. This will cause a Type Error and the program
    will crash once the input has been submitted.
# Solution:
     To fix the code, cast the input() as an 'int' to allow the numerical
     comparisons.
